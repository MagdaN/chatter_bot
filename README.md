Setup
-----

For testing and development, the application can be run using your regular user and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). For a production service, connected to the internet, an additional webserver (as reverse proxy) and a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database is recommended. The detailed setup instructions are covered on seperate pages:

* [Development setup](/docs/dev.md)
* [Production setup](/docs/prod.md)
