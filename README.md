chatbot
=======

Setup
-----

For testing and development, the chatbot can be run using your regular user and an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database. For a production service, connected to the internet, an additional webserver (as reverse proxy) and a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is recommended. The detailed setup instructions are covered on seperate pages:

* [Development setup](/docs/dev.md)
* [Production setup](/docs/prod.md)
